    <h2>What is Arduino?</h2>

    <p>
        Arduino is a popular open-source development board for engineers and makers to
        develop electronics projects in an easy way. It consists of both a physical programmable
        development board (based on AVR series of microcontrollers) and a piece of software or IDE which runs
        on your computer and used to write and upload the code to the microcontroller board.

        Explore below 200+ interesting arduino projects and
        tutorials based on different types of arduino baords like Arduino Uno
        , Arduino Pro Mini, etc. These DIY arduino projects for beginners are explained well
        and you can find the complete guide to DIY these projects with the help of circuit diagrams,
        source codes and videos. You can also browse below pages to get new arduino project ideas.

    <h2>What is Robotics?</h2>

    <p>

        The field of Robotics encompasses everything to do with the design,
        engineering, programming, testing and development of robots, machines designed
        to perform tasks currently or previously performed by humans. Robotics is growing rapidly
        with the advent of big data and the IoT and machines are now capable of processing large quantities
        of data and learning with minimal human interaction. Using autonomous vehicles as an example,
        the sensors on the vehicle process thousands of data points each second along with location data from
        the web to move the vehicle safely along its route. Robotics projects and applications can be found across
        a large number of industries from automotive production to military drone operations to landing on and
        exploring Mars.

    <h2>Online Courses in Robotics</h2>

    <p>
        Robotics courses cover multiple science, math and technology
        disciplines including machine learning, artificial intelligence,
        data science, design and engineering. Online courses and programs are
        designed to introduce you to each of these areas and jump start your career
        in this exciting and rapidly expanding field.

        The MicroMasters in Robotics from the University of
        Pennsylvania offers students the opportunity to learn the fundamentals
        of robotics from legendary professors at the GRASP (General Robotics, Automation,
        Sensing and Perception) Laboratory. You will learn the math and robot programming tools
        required to build robots, from the assessment of a real-world problem to the design and
        development of a solution. The 4-course online robotics program covers visual intelligence,
        machine learning, robot dynamics and control and locomotion engineering and is equivalent to
        30% of an on-campus Masters of Science in Engineering degree in Robotics.

        Columbia Universityâ€™s popular MicroMasters in Artificial Intelligence (AI)
        demonstrates how applications of machine learning can be used to solve complex problems.
        Learn how to manipulate robot arms including kinematic chains, forward and inverse kinematics,
        mobile robot map representations and gain experience planning complete robot systems.

    <h2>Robotics Jobs</h2>

    <p>

        There are quite a few options for career paths in the field of Robotics, from robot
        programming and engineering to construction, deployment, management and maintenance.
        Careerbuilder.com lists over 1,000 full-time positions with job titles such as Robotics Specialist,
        Robotics Technician, Mobile Robotics Application Engineer, Robotics Application Engineer and
        Lead Robotics Software Engineer. While there are many positions in the exciting world of robotics
        development and innovation, there is also huge demand for specialists that can maintain the millions
        of robotic machines already in use around the world. Almost all positions require advanced degrees or
        specializations in math and computer science and an internship will always lift you above the crowd when
        applying for that first job.
